<body>
  <p class="definition">Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measurement of a person’s weight with respect to his or her height. It is more of an indicator than a direct measurement of a person’s total body fat.
    BMI, more often than not, correlates with total body fat. This means that as the BMI score increases, so does a person’s total body fat.
    <br />
    The WHO defines an adult who has a BMI between 25 and 29.9 as overweight - an adult who has a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese - a BMI below 18.5 is considered underweight, and between 18.5 to 24.9 a healthy weight</p>
  <p class="uses">BMI is an indicator of total body fat in many individuals. Thus it is considered as an indicator of health risk.
    BMI is used by healthcare professionals to screen for overweight and obese individuals. The BMI is used to assess a person’s health risks associated with obesity and overweight.
    For example those with a high BMI are at risk of:-
    high blood cholesterol or other lipid disorders
    type 2 diabetes
    heart disease
    stroke
    high blood pressure
    certain cancers
    gallbladder disease
    sleep apnea and snoring
    premature death
    osteoarthritis and joint disease</p>
